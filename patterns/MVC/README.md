# MVC ( model-view-controller) Architecture

In programming, model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural design pattern that organizes an application's logic into distinct layers, each of which carries out a specific set of tasks. The layers also interact with each other to ensure that the application's functionality is delivered in a coordinated and consistent manner. The MVC methodology incorporates the entire application, from the user interface (UI) to the underlying data model.

# MVC Architecture in Todo Task List Application

For this issue, I will be explaining MVC architecture by writing code for to-do task list application. The Tech stack that I will be using is

```
React - For View Part
Mongodb and Javascript - For Model part (Database)
Node.js - For Controller part
```
